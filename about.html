		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<p>I am Creative Recruiter, living in Spanish Harlem. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I currently work with Aquent, the largest and only global creative and marketing staffing firm. I help creative talent secure great careers with Fortune 100 and 500 companies nationally! My overall goal is to increase my web design and development knowledge so that I can be more valuable to my existing clients and assist others with building their personal or business websites!</p>
