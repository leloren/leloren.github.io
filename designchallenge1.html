		<h1>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h1>

		<p>I am most inspired by <a href="http://earthbornpaints.co.uk/" >Earthborn Paints</a>  and the <a href="http://www.versace.com/" >Versace</a> websites.</p> 
		
		<h1>How do they exhibit effective uses of space, size or balance?</h1>

		<p>With Earthborn Paints I like the flow and feel of the webiste. The white space provides the user with clear focal points and guides the user to easily scroll down to view more information about the company and additional services and products offered. The design also does a good job converying the natural feel of the overall brand by the colors and images used. For the Versace site I like the way it draws the user in utilizing bold and edgy photographs and rich colors. It provides the user with very clear focal points on how to obtain more info on either shopping for products or learning more about the brand.</p>

		<h1>What makes them similar and different?</h1>

		<p>Earthborn Paints and Versace are similar in the way they utilized color to connect with their audience. They are different in their design approach to reach thier consumers.   Earthborn Paints provides a more simplistic approach and balanced design. Basically with one look you can see exactly where to go to obtain all the information needed to understand who they are and what they do. If you want to learn more you are also easily directed with arrows. With the Versace website it has a very distinct and rich feel, but seems to offer less balance and a clean and crisp feel as Earthborn Paints. The experience is less friendly and seems more crowded with content and images.</p>
