		<h1>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h1>

		<p>I am most inspired by Earthborn Paints and the Versace websites.</p> 
		
		<h1>How do they exhibit effective uses of space, size or balance?</h1>

		<p>With Earthborn Paints I like the flow and feel of the webiste. By using the white space it provides the user with clear focal points and guides the user to easily scroll down to view more information. The design also does a good job converying the natural feel of the product by the colors  and pictures used. For the Versace site I like the way it draws the user in utilizing bold and rich colors. It provides the user with very clear focal points on how to obtain more info on either the shopping products or learning more about the brand.
